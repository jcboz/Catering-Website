## Goal:
To gain experience using Flask and building data models via an ORM by
developing a website to help manage a catering company.

## High-level description:
I wrote a website to help manage a catering company. I considered three classes 
of users: the owner of the company, company staff, and registered customers. Customers can
request events on given days (or cancel events they had previously requested), staff can sign
up to work events, and the owner is given a rundown of what events are
scheduled and who is working each event. The company cannot schedule more than
1 event per day, and each event needs only 3 Staff members to run.
